# Typification of the demand generation relationship of Colombian electricity market and forecast of demand at an hourly-daily level based on consumption patterns

This project had the purpose of "establishing the relationship between the demand and the generation of the Colombian energy market by characterizing the hourly and daily consumption patterns and then the projection of the demand for electrical energy at the hourly-daily level. The dataset used had electricity demand and generation variables at the hourly and daily levels, from January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020" (Suárez L., Jején S., Patarroyo L., Conti D.; 2021).
